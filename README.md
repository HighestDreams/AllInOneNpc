## Why should i use this plugin instead other Npc/Slapper plugins?
1. This plugin focuses most of all on <strong>ease of use</strong> and code <strong>optimization</strong>.
2. Having more <strong>features</strong> than other existing plugins + features that will be added in the future.
3. By <a href="https://github.com/HighestDreams/AllInOneNpc/issues/new">reporting bugs or suggestions or your ideas</a> about adding a new feature, you can easily see the changes you want in the next update.
4. Fast updates, I think one of the biggest problems with any Pmmp plugin is its late updates by developer.
## How to use
You are not dumb enough to need this, RIGHT?
